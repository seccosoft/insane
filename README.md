<h2 id="110-why-insanecoin">1.1.0 Why insanecoin?</h2>

<p>Rebranding to insanecoin is a simple process, and the decision to do so was made for reasons of longevity. Trump is a spent force, and we predict he will be consigned somewhere very soon, and not a cosy place called the White House. There are no changes necessary to the wallet as the ticker will remain INSANE. During the next recompile, the splash screen and logo and will be updated. There is no reason to make any changes that affect functioning, so there will be no critical updates.</p>

<h2 id="20-a-little-history">2.0 A little History</h2>

<p>Originally trumpinsane as a venture was planned for release at about 500 blocks. INSANE was then supposed to be mined to 14,000 blocks and full PoS. A series of giveaways and stunts had been planned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="giving-all-coins-to-all-people-for-free">Giving all coins to all people for free</h3>

<p>However, doing this would have been <strong>selfish</strong>. A better more inclusive plan simplified matters by mining the coin to PoS in private, and then giving all the coins away, for free! Such a process and giveaway is other regarding, respects the basis of equality, regardless of ability to mine coins with expensive equipment, or hold an ICO to benefit the few. </p>

<p>In truth, we are all aware that there are more cryptocurrencies than is necessary.</p>

<p>However, <strong>Insanian Stakeholders</strong> would challenge a charge that it was making the pile of crap larger. INSANE is a <strong>unique cryptocurrency venture</strong>. </p>

<p>There are no leaders at INSANE, instead a Steering Board with representatives from Africa, Asia, Europe and the USA invested their own stake and agreed to ensure INSANE is moved in the best direction for stakeholders and humanity (sort of). </p>

<p>In turn, stakeholders have the right to petition the Steering Board, advise it on new potentials and question decisions it makes. We call it “win-win.”</p>
